                    <p>Iron Man, American comic book superhero, a mainstay of Marvel Comics, who first appeared in 1963
                        in Tales of Suspense no. 39. His creation is officially credited to four people: writer and
                        editor Stan Lee, who plotted the first story; his brother Larry Lieber, who scripted it; artist
                        Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby, who designed Iron Manâ€™s original armoured battlesuit.
                        Iron Man has appeared as the star of his own comic book series, as a regular guest in other
                        popular comics (most notably in the The Avengers), in animated films and television series, and
                        in live-action motion pictures.</p>
                    <h5>PROFILE:</h5>
                    <p>Inventor Tony Stark applies his genius for high-tech solutions to problems as Iron Man, the
                        armored Avenger.</p>
                    <h4>IRON-MAN</h4>
                    <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
                        character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and
                        designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of
                        Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).
                        Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.

                        A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist,
                        Anthony Edward Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt
                        to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of
                        armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and
                        other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit
                        and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true
                        identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.


                        Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of
                        the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various
                        comic book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated television shows and films. In
                        the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tony Stark was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the films Iron
                        Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3
                        (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man:
                        Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), while Mick
                        Wingert voiced the character in the animated series What If...? (2021).
